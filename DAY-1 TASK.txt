1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2?

First off all http stands for hyper text transfer protocol,the first version was introduced in 1997,
on those time it was very useful and fast but years rolled onn they people need some update because version http1.1,
 loads a single request for every Transmission Control Protocol connection and It compresses data by itself so ,
 In 2015 http2 was created .http2 is much faster and more reliable than http1,it was allows multiplexing 
 so one TCP connection is enough for multiple requests.also it commpress using hpack.




2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript?

Object is a unordered relational data,it is the form of “key”:”value”,
it can be a variable or functions and also called properties and methods or .

Example;
Let person =

age:24,

} ;
